# 🌐 My Awesome Website

Welcome! This is the beginning of my personal/project website.

## 📄 About This Site

This site will include:

- A homepage with a welcome message
- An "About Me" section
- A contact form or links
- Possibly a portfolio/gallery section

## 🛠️ Features I'm Planning

- Responsive design
- Light/dark mode
- Simple animations
- Maybe a blog section later

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

I'm using **GitHub Pages** to host this site for free.

Steps:
1. Start with `index.html` as a landing page.
2. Add CSS styling for layout and design.
3. (Optional) Add JavaScript for interactivity.
4. Push changes to GitHub.
5. Enable GitHub Pages under repository settings.
